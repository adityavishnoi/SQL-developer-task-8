# SQL-developer-task-8

Objective:
Automate actions using triggers and create procedures for reusable database operations.
 
Tasks to Perform
✅ 1. Triggers
● Automatically log updates in a separate table when student records change.
● Use AFTER UPDATE trigger to capture changes.
✅ 2. Procedures
● Create a stored procedure to update student grades based on their performance.
● Ensure flexibility to handle different grading criteria.
Deliverable: Automated logging and reusable grade update logic.

Explanation of Queries:

How Triggers Work
✔️ Triggers execute automatically after specific actions (e.g., insert, update, delete).
✔️ Used to log changes in a separate audit table.
How Procedures Work
✔️ Stored procedures encapsulate reusable SQL operations.
✔️ Helps in bulk updates like modifying student grades based on condition
